# ANSIFormatter
ANSIFormatter is a simple tool for formatting terminal output using ANSI escape codes in Java.

### How to Build
Clone the repository and run Ant in the root directory. 
```
git clone https://github.com/grr11/ANSIFormatter/
cd ANSIFormatter
ant
```
### Running tests
Most terminal emulators only support a subset of the ANSI escape sequences. To see which formats are supported by your system, navigate to the bin folder and run the jar file.
```
cd bin
java -jar ANSIFormatter.jar
```
